                            <p>Marco Polo was born in the thirteenth century (1254 A.D.) in Venice, an Italian
                                city-state, and he was very much a man of his time. He had the standard education for a
                                young gentleman--knowledge of classical authors and the basic beliefs of the church, a
                                good grasp of French and Italian, and skills in accounting.</p>

                            <p>Marco Polo sets out from Italy in 1271 at the age of 17 with his father and uncle, both
                                traders, on a journey across Asia, among the first Europeans to make such a trip. For 24
                                years, the Polos follow ancient trade routes through Persia, China, Indonesia, and
                                India.</p>

                            <p>Marco Polo meets Kublai Khan in Peking The emperor of Cathay was a monarch named Kublai Khan who lived in Peking. Marco Polo's father and uncle had been in
                            Cathay once before and had entertained Kublai Khan by telling him about the manners and customs of Europe. So when the
                            two Venetian merchants again appeared in Peking, Kublai Khan was glad to see them.</p>
